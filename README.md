# Week 1 Headstarter Accelerator Project 1: Customer Churn Prediction with Machine Learning
Week 1: Customer Churn Prediction with Machine Learning
In this project, you will build an end-to-end pipeline for a customer churn prediction model. You will learn how to load in the dataset, clean the data, train 5 different ML models, perform hyperparameter tuning, and serve the model for inference through a web app.

[Churn for Bank Customers](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mathchi/churn-for-bank-customers) Dataset from Kaggle. Predict customer churn in a bank. 

# Tasks

Train ML models on the Kaggle dataset to predict customer churn

Build the web app using Replit to get the model's predictions given customer data

Use an LLM to explain the model's predictions and generate a personalized email for the customer

Challenge: Retrain the ML models with different feature engineering and data pre-processing techniques to increase accuracy

Challenge: Train different ML models on the data and see how they perform. E.g. GradientBoostingClassifier, StackingClassifier

Challenge: Use different LLMs and prompting techniques to generate better explanations of the model's predictions and emails to customers

Challenge: Host the ML models on the cloud to be served via an API so that they can be used in other web apps

Challenge: Train ML models on a different dataset and see what's the highest accuracy you can achieve
