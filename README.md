Week 1: Customer Churn Prediction with Machine Learning
In this project, you will build an end-to-end pipeline for a customer churn prediction model. You will learn how to load in the dataset, clean the data, train 5 different ML models, perform hyperparameter tuning, and serve the model for inference through a web app.
